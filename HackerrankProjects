--Below are Hackerrank Projects that I started working on June 26 2023 to practice SQL

--1. Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.
Select * From City Where Population > 100000 And Countrycode = 'USA';

--2. Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA.
Select Name From City Where Countrycode = 'USA' and Population > 120000;

--3. Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer. 
The STATION table is described as follows:

Select distinct City From Station Where mod(Id,2) = 0;
--The way to find an even number simply is to find the remainder when you divide a column number by 2. It will equal 0 if it is an even number, 
--Otherwise it is an odd number.
