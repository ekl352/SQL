--Below are Hackerrank Projects that I started working on June 26 2023 to practice SQL

--1. Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.
Select * From City Where Population > 100000 And Countrycode = 'USA';

--2. Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA.
Select Name From City Where Countrycode = 'USA' and Population > 120000;

--3. Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer. 
The STATION table is described as follows:

Select distinct City From Station Where mod(Id,2) = 0;
--The way to find an even number simply is to find the remainder when you divide a column number by 2. It will equal 0 if it is an even number, 
--Otherwise it is an odd number. 

--4. Query the two cities in Station with the shortest and longest city names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e. number of char in name)

select City, length(City) from Station order by length(City), City limit 1; 
select City, length(City) from Station order by length(City) desc, City limit 1; 

--5. Query the list of City names starting with vowels (i.e. a, e, i, o, u) from Station. Your result cannot contain duplicates

Select distinct City From Station Where lower(substr(City,1,1))in('a','e','i','o','u');
--notes: The SUBSTR() function extracts a substring from a string (starting at any position). and Lower() converts the text to lowercase

--6. Query the list of City Names ending with vowels (a,e,i,o,u) from Station.
Select distinct City From Station Where City Like '%a'
Or City Like '%e'
Or City Like '%i'
Or City Like '%o'
Or City Like '%u'
;

--7. Query the list of City names from Station which have vowels (a,e,i,o,u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates

Select distinct City From Station Where lower(Left(city,1)) IN ('a','e','i','o','u')
And lower(Right(city,1)) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

The Left() and Right() functions pick the leftmost character, and the rightmost character. 

--8. Query the list of City names from Station that do not start with vowels. 

Select distinct City From Station Where NOT lower(Left(city,1)) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

--9. Query the list of City Names from station that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels.
