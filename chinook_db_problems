--Below are practice problems utilizing the chinook database found on Charlotte Chaze's
--Data Analytics course. The dataset, chinook, represents a digital media store and 
--includes these tables: artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

//1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

  Select FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
  From chinook.customers Where Country <> 'USA';

//2. Show only the customers from Brazil

  Select FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country From chinook.customers Where Country = 'Brazil';

//3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should
//show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

Select cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
From chinook.invoices inv
Left Join chinook.customers cust
On inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
Where inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

//4. Show the employees who are sales agents

Select FirstName, LastName, Title From chinook.employees Where Title Like "%Sales%Agent%"; 

//5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

Select Distinct BillingCountry From chinook.invoices;

//6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
//The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

 Select e.FirstName, e.LastName, i.invoiceid
  From (chinook.employees e
  Join chinook.customers c
  On c.supportRepId = e.EmployeeId)
  Join chinook.invoices i On i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId; 

//This is a cool example of doing three Joins at once. You'll see in the parentheses
//we're doing a join of employees and customers, then outside of the parentheses we
//Join on invoices. 


//7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all
//invoices and customers.

Select i.Total as 'Invoice Total', c.FirstName as 'Customer', c.LastName as 'Name', c.Country, e.FirstName as 'Sales', e.LastName as 'Agent Name'
 From (chinook.invoices i Full Join chinook.customers c 
   On i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId)
   Join chinook.employees e
   On e.EmployeeId = c.supportRepId;

//8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
Select count(invoiceId) From chinook.invoices
Where InvoiceDate Like '2009%';

Or
Select count(invoiceId) From chinook.invoices
Where InvoiceDate Between '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

//9. What are the total sales for 2009?
Select Sum(Total) From chinook.invoices
Where InvoiceDate Like '2009%';

Or 
Select Sum(Total) From chinook.invoices
Where InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

//10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

  Select i.InvoiceLineId, t.Name
  From chinook.invoice_items i
  Left Join chinook.tracks t
  On i.TrackId = t.TrackId
  Order By InvoiceLineId;

START HERE

//11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

Select i.InvoiceLineId, t.Name as 'Purchased Track Name', ar.Name as 'Artist Name' From ((chinook.invoice_items i
  Left Join chinook.tracks t
  On i.TrackId = t.TrackId)
  Left Join chinook.albums a
  On a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId)
  Join chinook.artists ar 
  On ar.ArtistId = a.ArtistId
  Order By i.InvoiceLineId;

//12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the
//Album name, Media type, and Genre.

Select t.Name as 'Track Name', a.Title as 'Album Name', m.Name as 'Media Type',
 g.Name as 'Genre'
 From ((chinook.tracks t 
 Left Join chinook.albums a
 On t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId)
 Left Join chinook.media_types m 
 On m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId)
 Left Join chinook.genres g 
 On g.GenreId = t.GenreId
 Order By t.Name;  

//13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
Select distinct e.FirstName as 'Sales Agent First', e.LastName, Sum(i.Total) OVER (PARTITION BY e.LastName) as 'Total Sales'
 From (chinook.employees e
 Join chinook.customers c
 On e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId)
 Join chinook.invoices i
 On c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;

//14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

Select distinct e.FirstName as 'Sales Agent First', e.LastName, Sum(i.Total) OVER (PARTITION BY e.LastName) as "Total_Sales"
 From (chinook.employees e
 Join chinook.customers c
 On e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId)
 Join chinook.invoices i
 On c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
 Where i.InvoiceDate Like '2009%'
 Order By Total_Sales desc Limit 1;

//15. How many years of Sales Data is in this database?
Select distinct strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) as 'Year' From chinook.invoices;
 
//16. Which year had the highest sales? 
Select distinct strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) as "Year", sum(Total) OVER (PARTITION BY strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate)) as "Yearly_Sales" From chinook.invoices
Order By Yearly_Sales desc Limit 1; 

//17. Which Genre had the highest sales?

//18. Which artist sold the most albums? 
//19. Which country had the largest amount of customers? 
//20. Which country had the lowest amount of customers?
