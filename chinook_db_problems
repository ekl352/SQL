--Below are practice problems utilizing the chinook database found on Charlotte Chaze's
--Data Analytics course. The dataset, chinook, represents a digital media store and 
--includes these tables: artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

//1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

  Select FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country From chinook.customers Where Country <> 'USA';

//2. Show only the customers from Brazil

  Select FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country From chinook.customers Where Country = 'Brazil';

//3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should
//show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

Select cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
From chinook.customers cust
Left Join chinook.invoices inv
On cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId;

//4. Show the employees who are sales agents

Select FirstName, LastName, Title From chinook.employees Where Title Like "%Sales%Agent%"; 

//5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

Select Distinct BillingCountry From chinook.invoices;
