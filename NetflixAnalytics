# In this sql code I'm querying a database that holds Netflix information. I've answered different questions about this database below. 

#1. How many movie titles are in the database?
select count(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added? 
Select max(date(date_added))
From "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
Select title
From "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
Order By title asc;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
Select director
From "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
Join "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
On people.show_id = titles.show_id
Where title = 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
Select title, release_year
From "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
Where type = 'Movie'
Order by release_year asc
Limit 2;

#note- I started with Limit 1 for this question, but it turns out 2 movies were made in the oldest year. I ensured there wasn't a third by doing Limit 3.
